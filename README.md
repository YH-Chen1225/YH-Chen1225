### Effective Programming Practice for Economist:
This project replicates the paper Stefano DellaVigna and Devin Pope, 2018, "What Motivates Effort? Evidence and Expert Forecasts", Review of Economic Studies, 85(2): 1029â€“1069. The objective of this project is to rewrite all the codes in a more effective way and re-organize them. The main contribution of the paper is to quantitatively bridge the rewards and people's efforts by different functions; based on different reward mechanisms setup, people make different levels of effort. The details can be found in the following repository.

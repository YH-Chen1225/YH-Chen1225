## Project Experience
### Effective Programming Practice for Economist:
This project replicates the paper Stefano DellaVigna and Devin Pope, 2018, "What Motivates Effort? Evidence and Expert Forecasts", Review of Economic Studies, 85(2): 1029â€“1069. The objective of this project is to rewrite all the codes in a more effective way and re-organize them. The main contribution of the paper is to quantitatively bridge the rewards and people's efforts by different functions; based on different reward mechanisms setup, people make different levels of effort. The details can be found in the following repository.

### The analysis and comparison of the tree-based method with different simulation assumptions
This project is the expansion of the paper Comparison of Single and Ensemble Classifiers of Support Vector Machine and Classification Tree. Journal of Mathematical Sciences and Applications, 2(2), 17-20 (Utami, I.T., et al., 2014). In this project, the classification problem is the main focus; however, instead of applying SVM, several tree-based methods are discussed, and bagging and boosting methods are also included. Furthermore, both large and small dataset scenarios are discussed in the project. ROC curve, confusion matrix, and misspecification rate are taken as evaluation criteria. The details can be found in the following repository.
